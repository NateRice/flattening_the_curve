# "Flattening the Curve"
Visualization of the coronavirus "flattening of the curve" based on the SIR model of disease spread from epidemiology
coded in python using pyplot and numpy. Graphs are .png files, program is .py file.

The Rnot value in the SIR model is a measure of the reproduction rate of the disease. The lower the Rnot value the less the disease is able to spread and infect people. We can think of preventative measures of disease spread like social distancing, wearing a mask, and staying at home as representing a low Rnot value. In this way we can see the effect of these preventative measures on the maximum number of people infected and the infection and recovery rate over time.
